				<p>I graduated from Galatasaray Highschool in 2016 (148). I achieved great success there both academic
					and
					extra-curricular becoming Music Club's co-president and participating in voluntary work. I enrolled
					in Acibadem
					Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University's Engineering Faculty's Medical Engineering program which led me to
					an inclusive
					curriculum in various fields of biotechnology like nanomedicine, biosensors, medical electronics,
					biostatistics,
					biomaterials, etc. However, since my sophomore year, I became more interested in software as medical
					devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					For 2 years, I have been involved in various projects within my school under the umbrella of
					Acibadem Data Analysis
					Laboratory (ADALAB) as the Head of Student Projects. I was involved heavily involved in computer
					vision projects
					however I also became more involved in Natural Language Processing. I also worked at Acibadem Mehmet
					Ali Aydinlar
					University IT Department, Hemosoft, Softtech and University of South Carolina Siemens Healthineers
					as Software
					Development Intern to further my knowledge on various topics such as IoT, data analysis and
					structure, dashboards,
					animation, and web design also learning Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C#, and Java by applying them
					on tasks I got
					from aforementioned companies along the way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, I obtain my master's degree on Artificial Intelligence in Ozyegin University.
